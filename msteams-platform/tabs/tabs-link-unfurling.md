# Tabs link unfurling and Stage View

The collaborative experience of Teams platform is enhanced continuously with addition of new features. In this process of continuous enhancement, a new UI component, called Stage View is built in Teams. 

Stage View allows you to render the content that is opened in full screen in Teams and pinned as a tab. To allow the users to use this feature, let us understand how to adopt the Stage View in your app.
 
## Stage View

Stage View is a giant, full screen UI component that you can invoke to surface your web content. The existing link unfurling service is updated so that it is used to turn URLs into a tab using an Adaptive Card and Chat Services. 

## Understand how the Stage View works

When a user sends an URL in the chat or channel, the URL is unfurled to an Adaptive Card. The user gets the UI and tab information through the card, and pins the content as a tab directly from the Stage View.

The following image explains how the Stage View works:

## Advantage of Stage View

The Stage View provides users with a more seamless experience of viewing content in Teams, instead of browser. Also, users will be able to pin the content to the chat/channel for future quick access. With this improvement in user experience, it will lead to more engagement with your app within Teams.

##  Stage View vs. Task module

* Stage View is useful when you have a rich content to display to the users, such as a page, a dashboard, a file, and so on. It provides  maximum real estate that helps to render your content in the full-screen canvas. 
* [Task module](../task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-tabs.md) is especially useful to display messages that requires user's attention or collect information required to move to the next step.
## Invoke the Stage View

You can invoke the Stage View in the following  ways: 

* Invoke Stage View from an Adaptive Card.
* Invoke Stage View through a deep link.

## Invoke Stage View from an Adaptive Card

When the user enters an URL, the bot is invoked and returns an [Adaptive Card](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions.md) with the option to open the URL in a stage. After a stage is launched, and the `tabInfo` is passed in, you can add the ability to pin the stage as a tab.  

The following images display a stage opened from an Adaptive Card:

### Example 

Following is the code to open a stage from an  Adaptive Card:

```json
{
    type: "Action.Submit",
    title: "View",
    data: {
          msteams: {
            type: "invoke",
            value: {
                type: "tab/tabInfoAction",
                tabInfo: {
                    contentUrl: contentUrl,
                    websiteUrl: websiteUrl,
                    name: "Tasks",
                    entityId: "entityId"
                 }
                }
            }
        }
} 
```

The `invoke` request type must be `composeExtension/queryLink`. 

> [!NOTE]
> * `invoke` workflow is similar to the current `appLinking` workflow. 
> * To keep consistency, it is recommended to name the `Action.Submit` as `View`.


**To invoke Stage View**

1. When the user selects **View**, the bot receives an `invoke` request. The request type is `composeExtension/queryLink`.
1. `invoke` response from bot contains an Adaptive Card with type `tab/tabInfoAction` in it.
1. The bot responds with a `200` code.

## Invoke Stage View through deep link

To invoke the deep link from your tab, you must wrap the deep link URL in `microsoftTeams.executeDeeplink(url)` API. 

The following image displays a Stage View invoked through a deep link:

### Syntax 

Following is the syntax of a deeplink:  

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/{appId}/0?context={“contentUrl”:”[contentUrl]”,“websiteUrl”:”[websiteUrl]”, “title”:”[title]”}

### Examples

Following are the deep link examples to invoke the Stage View:

#### Example 1

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/stage/2a527703-1f6f-4559-a332-d8a7d288cd88/0?context={“contentUrl”:”https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2Fteams%2FLokisSandbox%2FSitePages%2FSandbox-Page.aspx”, “websiteURL”:”https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2Fteams%2FLokisSandbox%2FSitePages%2FSandbox-Page.aspx”, “title”:”Contoso”}

#### Example 2

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/Meeting_Stage/2a527703-1f6f-4559-a332-d8a7d288cd88/0?context={“contentUrl”:”https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2Fteams%2FLokisSandbox%2FSitePages%2FSandbox-Page.aspx”, “websiteURL”:”https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2Fteams%2FLokisSandbox%2FSitePages%2FSandbox-Page.aspx”, “title”:”Contoso”}

> [!NOTE]
> * The `title` is optional in the deeplink. If not included, the app name replaces it. 
> * The deeplink can also be passed through  an `OpenURL` action.
